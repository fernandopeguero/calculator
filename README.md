# Calculator

A sleek and interactive calculator built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, designed to handle both essential and advanced arithmetic tasks while providing a responsive user experience.

This calculator project highlights my proficiency in JavaScript for efficient calculation logic, HTML for structured layout, and CSS for a modern, user-friendly interface.
